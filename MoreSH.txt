Let us imagine to ourselves
a world only peopled with beings of no thickness, and
suppose these “infinitely flat” animals are all in one and
the same plane, from which they cannot emerge. Let us
further admit that this world is sufficiently distant from
other worlds to be withdrawn from their influence, and
while we are making these hypotheses it will not cost
us much to endow these beings with reasoning power,
and to believe them capable of making a geometry. In
that case they will certainly attribute to space only two
dimensions. But now suppose that these imaginary animals, while remaining without thickness, have the form
of a spherical, and not of a plane figure, and are all on
the same sphere, from which they cannot escape. What
kind of a geometry will they construct? In the first place,
it is clear that they will attribute to space only two dimensions. The straight line to them will be the shortest
distance from one point on the sphere to another—that
is to say, an arc of a great circle. In a word, their geometry will be spherical geometry. What they will call
space will be the sphere on which they are confined, and
on which take place all the phenomena with which they
are acquainted. Their space will therefore be unbounded, since on a sphere one may always walk forward without
ever being brought to a stop, and yet it will be finite;
the end will never be found, but the complete tour can
be made. Well, Riemann’s geometry is spherical geometry extended to three dimensions. To construct it, the
German mathematician had first of all to throw overboard, not only Euclid’s postulate but also the first axiom that only one line can pass through two points. On
a sphere, through two given points, we can in general
draw only one great circle which, as we have just seen,
would be to our imaginary beings a straight line. But
there was one exception. If the two given points are at
the ends of a diameter, an infinite number of great circles
can be drawn through them. In the same way, in Riemann’s geometry—at least in one of its forms—through
two points only one straight line can in general be drawn,
but there are exceptional cases in which through two
points an infinite number of straight lines can be drawn.
So there is a kind of opposition between the geometries
of Riemann and Lobatschewsky. For instance, the sum
of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles
in Euclid’s geometry, less than two right angles in that
of Lobatschewsky, and greater than two right angles in
that of Riemann. The number of parallel lines that can be drawn through a given point to a given line is one
in Euclid’s geometry, none in Riemann’s, and an infinite
number in the geometry of Lobatschewsky. Let us add
that Riemann’s space is finite, although unbounded in
the sense which we have above attached to these words.
Surfaces with Constant Curvature.—One objection,
however, remains possible. There is no contradiction between the theorems of Lobatschewsky and Riemann; but
however numerous are the other consequences that these
geometers have deduced from their hypotheses, they had
to arrest their course before they exhausted them all, for
the number would be infinite; and who can say that if
they had carried their deductions further they would not
have eventually reached some contradiction? This difficulty does not exist for Riemann’s geometry, provided
it is limited to two dimensions. As we have seen, the
two-dimensional geometry of Riemann, in fact, does not
differ from spherical geometry, which is only a branch
of ordinary geometry, and is therefore outside all contradiction. Beltrami, by showing that Lobatschewsky’s
two-dimensional geometry was only a branch of ordinary
geometry, has equally refuted the objection as far as it
is concerned. This is the course of his argument: Let us
consider any figure whatever on a surface. Imagine this figure to be traced on a flexible and inextensible canvas
applied to the surface, in such a way that when the canvas
is displaced and deformed the different lines of the figure
change their form without changing their length. As a
rule, this flexible and inextensible figure cannot be displaced without leaving the surface. But there are certain
surfaces for which such a movement would be possible.
They are surfaces of constant curvature. If we resume
the comparison that we made just now, and imagine beings without thickness living on one of these surfaces,
they will regard as possible the motion of a figure all
the lines of which remain of a constant length. Such a
movement would appear absurd, on the other hand, to
animals without thickness living on a surface of variable
curvature. These surfaces of constant curvature are of
two kinds. The curvature of some is positive, and they
may be deformed so as to be applied to a sphere. The geometry of these surfaces is therefore reduced to spherical
geometry—namely, Riemann’s. The curvature of others
is negative. Beltrami has shown that the geometry of
these surfaces is identical with that of Lobatschewsky.
Thus the two-dimensional geometries of Riemann and
Lobatschewsky are connected with Euclidean geometry
